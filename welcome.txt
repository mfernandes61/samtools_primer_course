Hi! 
This is a Docker container running a Shellinabox environment
to provide the tools and data files for E. Cerami's SAMtools primer tutorial course.
The materials are in the directory /course_material. The requiste software is pre-installed for you (SAMtools etc).
You should connect /home/guest to a local disk (via Kitematic settings) and do any writing of files there
e.g. copying data from the coure materials directory using the linux cp command (see man cp if unsure).
Happy learning!
